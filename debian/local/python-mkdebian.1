.SH NAME
python\-mkdebian \- Generate a suitable Debian source package for a standard distutils application

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B python\-mkdebian
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This script generates a reasonably Debian Policy compliant Debian source
package for a Python application that uses distutils properly. It assumes that
there are no public Python modules, and generates just a single application
binary package.

Information is taken from setup.py's generated .egg-info file: author, project
name, description, version, upstream source, license, and required and provided
Python modules (which are translated to Debian python library package names,
and automatically added as package dependencies).

It generates a simple cdbs/python-support rules file.

.B python\-mkdebian
was designed to be used with the
.B DistUtilsExtra.auto
module, which calculates required Python dependencies automatically. However,
it makes no explicit assumptions about
.B DistUtilsExtra\fR,
so if
.B setup.py
has complete information it will work with any distutils setup.
